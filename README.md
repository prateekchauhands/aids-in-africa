# AIDS in Africa

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the HIV/AIDS related deaths data in Africa from 1990-2019. The data is sourced from Our World In Data website and has been processed using Excel and Power Query Editor to create a database for easy management and analysis. Looker Studio has been used to explore the data visually and gain valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data for HIV/AIDS related deaths in Africa for the period 1990-2019. The data has been sourced from the [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids) website, which ensures its authenticity and reliability. The dataset includes information such as country, country code, death figures, age categories, and time period (yearly).

## Data Processing
The data obtained from the Our World In Data website requires some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Excel and Power Query Editor have been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Technologies Used
Excel and Power Query Editor: For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation into the database.

Looker Studio: For data analysis and visualization.

## Key Highlights
Nowhere in the world is the AIDS epidemic been more devastating than the continent of Africa. For South Africa, political turmoil and a long history of government denial fueled an epidemic that had reached disastrous proportions by the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Even today, despite plunging death rates and greater leadership on the AIDS war front, the rate of new HIV infections continues to rise year after year. As a result, South Africa remains the country with the largest single population of HIV-infected people in the world.

With an estimated 7.7 million people infected, it represents about 14% of the entire population. The HIV rate among adults is more than 20% or roughly 1 in 5 people!

- 20 percent of all people living with HIV are in South Africa, and 20 percent of new HIV infections occur there too.
- 45% of all deaths in the country can be attributed to HIV.
- 13% of South African blacks are infected with HIV versus 0.3% of South African whites.
